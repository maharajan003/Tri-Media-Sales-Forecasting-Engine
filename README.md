# Tri-Media-Sales-Forecasting-Engine


This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting sales based on advertising spend using linear regression. The dataset includes advertising budgets for TV, Radio, and Newspaper, with the goal of understanding how each medium contributes to overall sales. Here’s an updated README with the new project name "Tri Media Forecasting Engine":

Introduction
Tri Media Forecasting Engine is a machine learning project aimed at predicting sales based on advertising spends across three major media channels: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. Using Linear Regression, the project provides insights into the effectiveness of each medium and helps forecast future sales based on different ad budget allocations.

The model is evaluated through key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²). The project includes data visualization to help interpret the model's performance and results.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

TV: Advertising spend on TV in thousands of dollars.
Radio: Advertising spend on Radio in thousands of dollars.
Newspaper: Advertising spend on Newspapers in thousands of dollars.
Sales: Sales of the product in thousands of units.
This dataset is typically used in projects involving regression analysis and marketing strategy optimization.

Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Installation Steps
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/tri-media-forecasting-engine.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd tri-media-forecasting-engine
Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter notebook or upload it to Google Colab to run:

jupyter notebook tri-media-forecasting-engine.ipynb
How to Use
Load the dataset (advertising.csv) into the notebook.
Follow the steps for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training.
Use the trained model to make predictions for future advertising budgets.
Check the visualizations and metrics to interpret the model's performance.
You can experiment with different advertising spend values to see their impact on predicted sales.

Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted sales.
R² (R-squared): Explains the proportion of variance in sales that is accounted for by the advertising spend.
Visualizations
Regression Line: Visualizes the linear relationship between each advertising channel and sales.
Residual Plot: Helps visualize the error distribution to check for model fit.
Actual vs Predicted Sales: Shows how close the model's predictions are to actual sales.
Feature Importance (Coefficient Plot): Highlights the relative contribution of each advertising channel to sales.
Conclusion
The Tri Media Forecasting Engine demonstrates how linear regression can be effectively used to predict sales based on advertising spend across different media channels. Insights from this model can guide businesses in making informed marketing decisions, maximizing return on investment (ROI) across TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising.

Key Findings:
TV advertising has the largest impact on sales, followed by Radio.
Newspaper advertising has a lesser but still significant effect.
The model achieves a high R² and a low MSE, indicating good predictive performance
